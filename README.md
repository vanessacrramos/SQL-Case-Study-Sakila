# Sakila SQL Analysis 🎬
This repository showcases a series of SQL exercises performed as part of a data bootcamp. The exercises focus on data analysis and manipulation for the Sakila DVD Rental Company, a fictional DVD rental business. Each query explores different aspects of the company's operations, helping to drive data-driven business decisions.

This project was particularly unique because the Sakila database was highly normalized, requiring extensive use of joins and close reference to the Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram to understand table relationships. This structure provided valuable practice in working with complex, interconnected tables—essential skills for performing accurate queries in real-world, normalized databases.

## 📊 Project Overview
The SQL queries in this repository analyze various facets of the Sakila database, such as:
* Customer spending patterns and revenue insights;
* Inventory management and stock analysis;
* Rental statistics and frequency;
* Data quality checks and duplicate detection.

## 🗃️ Database Structure
The database contains several key tables, including:
* customers: Customer details such as name, contact, and rental history;
* films: Information about available DVDs, genres, rental rates, and stock;
* rentals: Transaction data on DVD rentals, including timestamps and return status;
* actors: Actor information linked to the films they appear in.
