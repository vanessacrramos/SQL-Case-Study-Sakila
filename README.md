# Sakila SQL Analysis 🎬
This repository showcases a series of SQL exercises performed as part of a data bootcamp. The exercises focus on data analysis and manipulation for the Sakila DVD Rental Company, a fictional DVD rental business with a wide collection of films and a diverse customer base. Each query explores different aspects of the company's operations, helping to drive data-driven business decisions.
